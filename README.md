# ant_colony_optimization
ACO is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. At the core of this behavior is the indirect communication between the ants with the help of chemical pheromone trails, which enables them to find short paths between their nest and food sources. ACO metaheuristics are specialized in solving the optimization problems in every iteration step by vaporizing and updating the pheromone density.
